# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project implements a **complete machine learning pipeline** using the UCI Heart Disease dataset to predict whether a person has heart disease based on clinical features.

## ðŸ“Š Project Summary
 I built and evaluated multiple classification models to predict heart disease presence, including:

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Model training with **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM**
- Evaluation using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1**, **ROC AUC**
